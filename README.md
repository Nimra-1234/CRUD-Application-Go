# CRUD-Application-Go
This is the basic CRUD application where I have created API which is being tested by Postman.
I have implemented 4 functions Create,Update,Delete,Read and connect through Postgresql 11.18.
Details for connecting database:
host := "localhost"
	port := "5430"
	dbName := "demo"
	dbUser := "nimra12"
	password := "1234"
  
  After thisopen Postman for re-checking.
