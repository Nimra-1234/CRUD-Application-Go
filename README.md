# CRUD-Application-Go
This is the basic CRUD application where I have created API which is being tested by Postman.
I have implemented 4 functions Create,Update,Delete,Read and connect through Postgresql 11.18.
Details for connecting database:
1. host := "localhost"
2. port := "5430"
3. dbName := "demo"
4. dbUser := "nimra12"
5. password := "1234"
  
  After thisopen Postman for re-checking.
